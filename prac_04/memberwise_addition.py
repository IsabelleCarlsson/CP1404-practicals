Memberwise Additionâ€¦
In Python, the + operator concatenates lists, so [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
What if we want to add the elements together instead?
Write a function, memberwiseAddition, that takes two lists, and returns the list that contains the sum
of elements that are in the same index in the two lists. For example:
memberwiseAddition([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) would return [5, 7, 9]
memberwiseAddition([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]) would return [2, 4, 6, 4]
